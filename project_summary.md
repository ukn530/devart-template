# Mosaic


## Authors
Tatsuya Uchida

## Description
Mosaic is a movie made up of movies. It is like a trick of [photographic mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic "photographic mosaic"). In this case, the medium is not a photo, but a movie.
I shot actors from above or below because I didn't want to make "up and down" in this screen to express a fractal world. Actors use some clothes to contrast image of cells in this movie.
